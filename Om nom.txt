Projects view:
Master todo list
  only shows incompleted ones
Projects todos
  Default shows incompleted todos per project
  Can ask to see all todos for project
  Project header displays number of incompleted todos left
Todos get tagged as they are pulled into days
Todos "disappear" once they are marked done


Can still view todos, including completed, by project

Way to keep maintain a list of larger questions

Components to todo:
- sub todos?
- comments
- project
- date
- doneness
